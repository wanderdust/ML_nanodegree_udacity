    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than *\\$50,000*. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the case of Amazon, the decision tree can take the information about the user (age, location, items purchased, sex ...) to recomend other products based on the data of previous users.\n",

    "* The best feature about decision trees is that they are very easy to interpret, since all the model does is breaking the data based on decisions it makes by asking questions (to be more specific, it makes a decision based on feature that once splitted has more information gain). Another advantage is its ability to capture complex non-linear relations ([Source: Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/selecting-the-best-machine-learning-algorithm-for-your-regression-problem-20c330bad4ef)). Also, it requires little data preparation, as DTs is not affected by the skewness of the data unlike other implementations ([Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Advantages)). Decision trees work best with classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The weakenesses of this model is that it tends to overfit when it gets to deep. To avoid overfitting a number of hyperparameters  can be used to set splitting \"limits\", such as maximum depth, minimum number of samples to split and minimum number of samples per leaf. Another fix for overfitting could be using an esemble method like Random Forests where several decision trees are built based on random features and vote for the most repeated prediction. Another weakness is that a small change in the data can lead to a large change in the structure of the optimal decision tree ([Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree#Advantages_and_disadvantages)). Decision trees perform poorly in terms of speed when using random forests with a very large dataset requiring more memory ([Source: Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/selecting-the-best-machine-learning-algorithm-for-your-regression-problem-20c330bad4ef))\n",

([Source: Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-using-a-naive-bayes-for-classification)).

Also they only work on binary classification, so if we wanted to use it for multi-class calassification we would need to use one per class, which would be very infefficient. SVMs also don't give any probabilities and they are not very intuitive for choosing hyperparameters [Source: Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-SVM-algorithms)).

    "The three models I've chosen are a Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVC. I'll compared the three based on the visualizations to decide which one will make the best predictions when optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've used accuracy and F-Beta score to compare the models. If we look at the accuracy for the training predictions, we can see that decision trees get almost 100%. Once we compare it with the accuracy of the testing set, we can see that it drops to 80%, leveled up with the SVC. This shows a high variance for the Decision trees, which is a sign of overfitting. The model has learned the training data too well and doesn't make great generalizations. In the other hand we can see that the SVC has similar results between training and testing predictions. This proves that the SVC works well at not overfitting the data. Finally and almost not worth mentioning is the Naive Bayes classifier, which gets only 60% accuracy on both training and testing. However accuracy is not the best metric to trust in this case, as we know the data is skewed towards people who make less than \\$ 50.000, and better predictions over that class would not show realistic results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second metric used is F-beta score, which is the best metric while working with skewed distributions like this one, as it is a ratio of precision and recall. The Decision Tree shows a really high score on this metric for the training data, and a much lower score for the testing data. This shows that during training the model had a very good precision and recall, probably from overfitting the training data, but during testing either precision or recall or both weren't really high, what comes from misclassifiyng the test set. Next we have the SVC which looks a lot more consistent, as we can see almost the same score for both testing and training.This is an indicator that the model didn't overfit, as it can generalize the new data with the same accuracy as it got from the training data. However a low score of 70 \\% during training shows that the model didn't do too well on getting a good precision when separating the data, which makes us think that maybe this isn't the best model to get the best boundary line to separate our data. Either that or the model just needs optimization, like using a different kernel for example. Finally we have the Naive Bayes classifier that gets a low score on both, which means that it is underfitting, not finding a good boundary to separate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of training time, both Naive Bayes and Decision Trees are very fast (almost instant training) compared to the SVC that takes a lot of time to train as it is memory intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the metrics discussed above for each model we can conclude that both the Decision Tree and the SVC show promise on making a good division of the data, and I think they will have similar performance when optimizing the model. However the Decision Tree is a lot more intuitive for optimizing, as well as so much faster, unlike the SVC which is quite hard to parametize as well as taking a long time for training. **For these reasons I've decided to continue with the Decision Tree classifier**."

The way a Decision tree works is by separating our data based on different paramaters and see if that split gives us any insights about the data. For example when we want to know what kind of person will download one app or another, a useful split parameter may be the age, as younger people will probably tend to download more games, and older people may tend to download social apps instead. We keep dividing our data using different parameters until the model makes a good classification, and we end up with what looks like a tree.\n",

    "It seems that I got some right, but was very wrong in others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only two of the features seem to have been confirmed with the visualization: age, and education-num. I think age is quite a decisive one as most people under some age will be very likely to make a lot of money, as most won't be working or will have part time jobs or jobs that require no qualification. Education num is a decisive feature as highly educated people (more years of learning) will be able to do more specialized jobs not available for unqualified people, thus a higher pay rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features I didn't discuss include capital-loss, capital-gain, and hours-per-week. After visualizing the chart I can understand how both capital-loss and capital-gain can affect the target variable. Capital refers to the value of an asset, and these assets are usually highly valuable (real state, shares etc.). People who have a big capital loss means they have lost a lot of money, and probablly won't be making enough money now. The opposite goes capital gain, where these people might have incurred in big monetary gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally hours-per-week is also a decisive one, as most people working less than full time will probably never make  as much as \\$ 50.000 or more."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "\n",
    "The F-Score reduces to 0.66 (5.5%) when reducing the training data, where the accuracy only reduces to 0.83, (2.25%). The reason why the f-score gets affected more than the accuracy is because most of the points still get correctly classified as 75% of the distribution belongs to people who make less than 50k which doesn't affect the accuracy too much. However the f-score measures the precision and recall, and we can tell this gets affected more because we are probably getting more False Positives (people who get predicted as they make more than 50k, but they really don't) than before. Because we want a high precision model, the f-beta score will get hurt more when the precision decreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "If speed was extremely relevant, I would consider dropping some of the features. However Decision trees train quite fast compared to other models, and if a better precision is more important than training time, I would keep all the features since the time differnece might be less than a second."
